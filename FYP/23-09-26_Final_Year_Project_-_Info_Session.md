# Milestones
## Proposal Submission
Submit your idea. Convince them you have a plan. It will be reviewed by the program director. This will happen mid October.
## Inspection Meeting
Convince them you are making good progress. This meeting will be between your inspector and yourself. This will happen mid November.
## Demonstration Meeting
Tell them how you are going to evaluate your project. Convince them that you have done what you proposed, and produced good results. This may use user acceptance tests and user feedback. Have some benchmark for success. This meeting will be between your inspector and yourself. This will happen late March.
## Final Report Submission
Your final report will need to be written *long* before the demo meeting. *Everything* is going to have to be in writing. It's an in depth analysis of how you did a thing, what methodologies were used, justified why you selected certain tech, etc. 
Show your benchmarks, and all your data. Explain why it's important.
# Types of Project
## Application based
It' like team project, but on your own. Same level of planning and documentation. Gather requirements, split your work, use 🎆agile🎆, etc.
## Research based
Identify a specific research area, and write a systematic review. Don't go beyond the frontier of the field, but look at the research people have done on it. Poke the frontier and run your experiment. Basically test peoples research with something new. See how various technologies perform on various datasets.
# Project Marking
TL;DR: the same grade boundaries unless you are doing Masters.
100 marks total.
Most people won't get 'Outstanding' grades of >80%. The 0.1% get these kind of marks.
40-49% is a pass. 30-39% is fail, and <30% is incomplete.
### Mark breakdown
 - Report: 30%. SPAG failure and bad structure will hurt your grade. 
 - Product: 20% 
    - App: fully complete software 
    - Research: outcome of research, analysis, and prototype
 - Process: 20%
	 - App: how well you have followed 🎆agile🎆, how you gathered requirements, how you built your personas, how you have performed your interviews, how your research has helped build your solution (
	 - Research: how you have built your pipeline, how the data was pre-processed, how the dataset was built and why that way, how you selected your model, how the model has been trained, how you have improved it iteratively. 
 - Demonstration/Management: 10%. Attendance to meetings, how motivated you are, how well your demo went (get more details)
 - Substantialness of the achievement: 20% 
	 - Apps: how useful your app would be, how challenging was it
	 - Research: how unique/different is your contribution

### Overview of what to expect with a project
Using just off the shelf parts and combining them together will get pass to lower good. You need to justify why you did a thing. Need insight. Need to be careful with report in this case. Even with poor results, if you justify yourself you will boost your marks.
## Project Proposal
Make sure your idea is feasible in 6 months. The supervisors will likely be out of idea simply because of the sheer amount of students.
### General structure
### Intro
Your motivation: why is this problem important and why do you want to solve it
Objective: what do you want to achieve
### Main body
Lit-Review: not the full version, but you should provide some background knowledge. What has been done, what has worked, and what hasn't worked.
Methodology: How are you going to approach this :star:agile:star:
Planning: schedule, deadlines, timeline, etc. Show your resource plan (what compute resources you need, what datasets, etc.) and contingency plan (what is your plan B, evaluate risks and mitigation). Do Gantt chart. The plan can change, but make sure you note it down. Changing your topic completely will be a massive issue.

## General Advice
Contact supervisor now. Organise your first meeting ASAP. Sort out regular meetings.
Plan your time, and stick to it.
LLMs are useful, but be careful with using them. Standard plagiarism and accuracy warnings apply. 
Punctuality is important. Late submission is 5 marks penalty.
Proposal templates and examples will be provided.
Your supervisor will tell you if your idea is simple/complex/complicated.
It's fine if your thing is not unique. You just need to justify it.
Contingencies are there to be used. You won't lose marks automatically for using them.
Research papers can be written in the usual formal format. Not necessary though.
Your project will not be funded. Anything you want to buy is off your own back. The school may provide some basic resources like GPU clusters.
