Define a function altMap :: (a -> b) -> (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b] that alternatively applies the two argument functions to successive elements in a list.
For example:

[10,101,12,103,14]

altMap :: (a -> b) -> (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]

altMap f g (x:xs) = f x : altMap g f xs

-- A substitution cipher is an old method of encryption, in which the cipher
-- takes a string and a key that is as long as the alphabet that the message
-- uses. In our case, the message will be expressed using the English alphabet so
-- our cipher key will be a string of length 26. This represents a mapping of each
-- letter of the alphabet to a different letter.
-- For example, the key "LYKBDOCAWITNVRHJXPUMZSGEQF" maps 'A' to 'L',
-- 'B' to 'Y', 'C' to 'K' and so on.

-- which takes a plaintext string (that might contain punctuation and spaces) and
-- an uppercase key and returns the ciphertext.
-- Note the following:

-- The capitalisation of the characters in the plaintext must be preserved by
-- your implementation.
-- The encryption should apply only to the letters (i.e. the alphabetic
-- characters) and punctuation and spaces should be ignored. For this purpose,
-- you can use the isLetter :: Char -> Bool function coming from Data.Char to
-- test if a given character is a letter.
-- You may wish to use the function

-- A famous theorem about prime numbers (called Chebyshev's Theorem) asserts that

-- Background Material (Part 2 - [5 out of 10 marks])
-- In number theory, a strong prime is a prime number that is greater than the
-- average of the nearest prime above and below. In other words, it is closer to
-- the succeeding prime than it is to the preceding one.
-- For example, 17 is the seventh prime: the sixth and eighth primes, 13 and 19,
-- add up to 32, and half of that is 16; 17 is greater than 16, so 17 is a strong
-- prime.

-- which takes as input the integer n and prints the first n strong prime
-- numbers.

-- Examples

-- ghci> strongPrimes 25
-- [11,17,29,37,41,59,67,71,79,97,101,107,127,137,149,163,179,191,197,223,227,239,251,269,277]

-- Background Material
-- Consider the following data type of directions

-- data Direction = MoveLeft
--                | MoveRight
--                | MoveUp 
--                | MoveDown
--                deriving (Eq, Show)


-- Let us define the type Command to consist of a pair of a Direction and an
-- Int.

-- type Command = (Direction, Int)


-- Given a coordinate pair (x, y), the execution of a command consists in
-- incrementing the corresponding coordinate.
-- So for example, executing (MoveLeft, 10) on the pair (5, 5) should result in
-- (-5, 5). (We use the mathematical indexing: "right" means increasing the x
-- coordinate and "up" means increasing the y coordinate).

-- Implementation Task
-- Write a function which, given an initial position (x, y), computes the final
-- position after the execution of a list of commands.

executeCommands :: [Command] -> (Int , Int) -> (Int , Int)
executeCommands [] (x,y) = (x,y)

-- Background Material
-- ATMs need to use an algorithm to compute, given an amount, the number of
-- currency notes needed to dispense the money requested by the customer.
-- In this question, you will implement such an algorithm in Haskell.

-- which takes an amount and a list of denominations in ascending order (such as
-- [10, 20, 50, 100]) and returns a list of pairs of denominations and number of
-- notes to be dispensed (with the fewest number of notes).

-- Examples

-- ghci> atmChange 2180 [10, 50, 100, 500]
-- [(500,4),(100,1),(50,1),(10,3)]


-- In the above example, the user has asked for Â£2180 with allowed denominations of
-- 10, 50, 100, and 500. The algorithm computes that the ATM will need to dispense
-- 4 bills of 500, 1 bill of 100, 1 bill of 50 and 3 bills of 10.
-- Note that 2180 = 4 x 500 + 1 x 100 + 1 x 50 + 3 x 10
-- Some more examples follow.
